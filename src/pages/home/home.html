  <p class="about-text" id="word"> coffee hop </p>
  <p class="about-text">To spend a large portion of the day downtown, or in another area abundant in coffee shops, visiting as many coffee shops as possible. When coffee hopping, one buys a small coffee/pastry, spends some time in a coffee house, then moves on to another coffee shop to pass the time. (Can also be defined as attempting to sit for as long as possible in a coffee shop without purchasing anything, then moving onto another place when the barista is on to you.)</p>

  <p class="about-text" id="about_desc">Coffee Hop was created as a crowdsourcing platform for students and general residents with respect to cafe fullness. One of the most annoying problems I experience on a day to day basis is arriving at a cafe to find that all the seats are taken. Coffee Hop hopes to address this problem by attempting to give an accurate estimation of people that are checked in to a certain location.
