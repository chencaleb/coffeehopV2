  <p class="about-text" id="word"> coffee hop </p>
  <p class="about-text">To spend a large portion of the day downtown, or in another area abundant in coffee shops, visiting as many coffee shops as possible. When coffee hopping, one buys a small coffee/pastry, spends some time in a coffee house, then moves on to another coffee shop to pass the time. (Can also be defined as attempting to sit for as long as possible in a coffee shop without purchasing anything, then moving onto another place when the barista is on to you.)</p>

  <p id="example"> Tom: You were downtown for 16 hours? What'd you do the whole time?
  <br>
  Jerry: Coffee hopped.
  <br>
  Tom: How many places did you go?
  <br>
  Jerry: Twelve.
  </p>

  <p class="about-text" id="about_desc">Coffee Hop was created as a crowdsourcing platform for students and general residents with respect to cafe fullness. Viewers can input their observations in the form of percentages as well additional commentary. Input from users will dynamically update a progress bar indicating the average fullness of the cafe within the last hour. </p>
